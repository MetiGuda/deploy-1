    <h1>About Reptiles</h1>
  </section>
  <article class="txt">
    <p>Air-breathing vertebrates known as reptiles have unique skin made of scales, bony plates, or a combination of the
      two.</p>


    <p>They consist of <i>tortoises</i>, <i>turtles</i>, <i>lizards</i>, <i>snakes</i>, and <i>crocodiles</i>. All of
      them periodically shed their skin's
      outer layer. The temperature of their environment affects how they function.</p>

    <br />
    Reptiles do not maintain a constant internal body temperature, in contrast to birds and mammals. They cannot stay
    warm on a cold day without fur or feathers, and they cannot cool off on a hot day without sweat glands or the
    ability to pant. Instead, they shift as needed between the sun and the shade. They stop moving around when the
    weather gets colder. Reptiles are cold-blooded due to their slow metabolic rate and heat-seeking behavior.</p>
    <br />
    <p>Temperature also affects reptile reproduction. Only boas and pythons produce living offspring. The other species
      leave after laying their eggs in a modest nest. Within days to months, the eggs hatch. The amount of male or
      female hatchlings is dependent on the soil temperature at this time. Within hours of birth, young reptiles can
      glide, walk, and swim. In the Mesozoic era, which lasted for 270 million years until the extinction of the
      dinosaurs, reptiles predominated the animal kingdom. They first appear in the fossil record 315 million years ago.

  <h2>Types of Reptiles</h2>
  <section class="list">
    <ol type="A">
      <li>
        <h3>Squamata</h3>

          <figcaption>Snake</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>The word Squamata originates from the Latin meaning “having scales“. This reptile order contains worm lizards (aka amphisbaenians), lizards, and snakes. According to May 2021 statistics, about 71 families and over 11,500 reptile species were identified and classified under Squamata.</p>
      </li>
      <br/>
      <li>
        <h3>Testudines</h3>
        <figure>
          <img src="../images/turtle.jpg" alt="turtle" width="300px" height="200px">
          <figcaption>Turtle</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>Chelonia is an alternate name for Testudines. The word ‘Testudines‘ is based on the Latin word for tortoise – testudo. This reptile order contains turtles, terrapins, and tortoises. All species under this order have a hard carapace (cartilaginous shell) covering their bodies. There are 14 families and 335 species of reptiles classified under this reptile order.</p>
      </li>
      <br/>
      <li>
        <h3>Crocodilia</h3>
        <figure>

          <figcaption>Crocodile</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>As the name indicates, this reptile order contains reptiles such as crocodiles, alligators, caimans, and gavials. These mostly giant, predatory, semiaquatic reptiles are also known as crocodilians. They first appeared about 95 million years ago in the Late Cretaceous period and are the closest relatives to birds. There are three different families and 23 different species listed under Crocodilia.</p>

        <h3>Rhynchocephalia</h3>

          <figcaption>Lizard</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>This reptile order contains just one family and only one living species named Tuataras, and they are endemic to New Zealand. The oldest fossil recording of this reptile goes back to the Middle Triassic, around 240 million years ago. Most reptiles in this order are extinct now. Albert Günther of England, in 1867, proposed this reptile order Rhynchocephalia (means “beak head“) for the Tuatara and their fossil counterparts after observing its features similar to birds, turtles, and crocodiles.</p>
