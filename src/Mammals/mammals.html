    <h1>About Mammals</h1>
  </section>
  <article class="info">
    <p>Mammals include humans and all other animals that are warm-blooded vertebrates (vertebrates have backbones) with
      hair. They feed their young with milk and have a more well-developed brain than other types of animals.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Mammals are among the most adaptable animals on the planet.</p>
    <br>
    <p>They are found on every continent and in every ocean, and range in size from tiny bumblebee bats to enormous blue
      whales. One reason for their success is the way they move. Mammals as a group use every possible form of
      locomotion. Terrestrial species walk, run, jump, climb, hop, swing, dig, and burrow. Aquatic ones swim, shuffle,
      and dive. A few even fly.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Diet and behavior vary, too. Many carnivores, for example, are top predators that live generally solitary lives.
      These include jaguars, tigers, and polar bears. By contrast, lions, otters, wolves, and dolphins live in family
      groups. Even more social are some of the herbivores, especially hoofed animals like deer and zebra. By living in
      large groups, they gain both protection against becoming another animal’s meal and more opportunities to breed.
      Among omnivores, primates are known for their high intelligence, and rodents for their high numbers.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Mammal bones, especially skulls, are used for identification, and to work out the evolutionary history of each
      species. The jaws of a house cat are more lion- than wolf-like, for example. The teeth of horses and zebras look
      alike. The ear bones of mammals were once the jaws of prehistoric reptiles. And so on.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Despite these differences, all mammals share four traits that are shown in the diagram below: hair, mammary
      glands, a hinged jaw, and three tiny middle ear bones. Most have specialized teeth and moveable external ears.</p>

    <h4>Mammals have the following characteristics:</h4>
    <ol>
      <li>They are covered with hair or fur.</li>
      <li>They are warm-blooded (meaning their internal body temperature
        is maintained at a constant level
        regardless of external conditions)</li>
      <li>
        <p>They are usually born alive and relatively well-developed, having grown inside the mother’s body in a special
          organ called a uterus. The time spent developing in the
          uterus before birth is called the gestation period and
          varies in length from species to species (from about
          13 days in the Virginia opossum to 210 days in the
          white-tailed deer).</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>After birth the young are fed with milk that is produced by mammary glands.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>They have larger and more complex brains than
          any other group of animals</p>
      </li>
    </ol>

  <h2>Types of Mammals</h2>

      <h3>Marsupial Mammals</h3>
      <p>This type of mammal gives birth to the barely formed offspring, and the baby grows on a pouch on the mother’s
        belly. From there, babies drink their mother’s milk to get all nutrients and become fully evolved babies.
        Marsupial mammals belong to the Sub-class Metatheria.</p>

      <br/>
      <h3>Monotremes Mammals</h3>
      <p>This type of mammals lay eggs, and the offsprings come out from the hatched eggs. These are the ancient form of
        mammals, and even today, these mammals do exist. The babies feed on their mother’s milk, similar to other
        mammals. Monotremes mammals belong to the Sub-class Prototheria.</p>

          <figcaption>Giraffe</figcaption>
      </figure>
    <br/>
      <h3>Placental Mammals</h3>
      <p>This type of mammal constitutes a more significant chunk of mammals in the animal kingdom. The offsprings grow
        into a well-formed structure inside the mother’s belly for a long time (time differs between the size and shape
        of mammals) before the mother gives birth to them when ready. The baby in the womb gets nourishment from the
        mother’s diet via the umbilical cord (attached to the mother) inside the placenta (an organ where the baby
        grows). The placental mammals belong to the sub-class Eutheria.</p>
